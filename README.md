# [**Robust**](https://north-river1015.github.io/Robust/)


A browser that only shows (relatively) reliable sites. 

I realized that many times I'm doing school research, we're only using limited sources---but have other sites come up on google and other browsers. 
This is why I created this web browser **Robust** where only limited, reliable source appeares. 
I filtered using google's API, only allowing domains .edu, .org and other reliable .com domains(like bbc.com).

I still have to modify this code, but I shipped it for the t-shirt. I got help from copilot for quicker development. 

To do list:
-polish UI
-create logo
-use nest instead of localhost
-add "about" page?
