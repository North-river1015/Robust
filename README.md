## ðŸ¤” Why did I build this project?

As a student, I found that my research often relied on a handful of trusted sources. However, all web browsers I know provided some questionable sources. When you want to get your research done quick, those are not very helpful.


This is exactly why I created this web browser **Robust**. **Robust** is browser that only shows (relatively) reliable sites. 
I filtered using google's API, only allowing domains .edu, .org and other reliable .com domains(like bbc.com).

I got help from copilot for quicker development and numerous youtube videos and blogs that helped me creat this. I want to thank them deeply.

## To do list:

+ polish UI

+ create logo

+ use nest instead of localhost

+ add "about" page?

+ Add favicon
