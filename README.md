## What's behind this project?
A browser that only shows (relatively) reliable sites. 

I realized that many times I'm doing school research, I'm only using limited number of sources---but have other sites come up on google and other browsers. 

This is why I created this web browser **Robust** where only limited, reliable source appeares. 
I filtered using google's API, only allowing domains .edu, .org and other reliable .com domains(like bbc.com).

I still have to modify this code, but I shipped it for the t-shirt. I got help from copilot for quicker development. 

##To do list:

+polish UI

+create logo

+use nest instead of localhost

+add "about" page?

+Add favicon
